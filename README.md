# CH32V003_lib_GPIOCTRL

## **NOTE:** This library is currently only tested and built for the CH32V003.  
Other variants of the CH32Vxxx MCU Family have not been tested or considered
yet.  

lib_GPIOCTRL is a library to add runtime GPIO Suppor, much like the Arduino
system.  
This library may use more flash, and may be marginally slower than the 
`ch32v003fun` GPIO control in rare cases, but it is overall very comparable in
speed - Speed tests are available below.  

## Why Use This Library
The main benefiet to this library is that it provides 



## TODO
* Analog Read
* Analog Write
* Speed tests
* Profile and optimise footprint
